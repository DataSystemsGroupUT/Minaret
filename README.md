#### <a href="https://bigdata.cs.ut.ee/minaret/">MINARET</a>, a recommendation framework for selecting scientifc reviewers. The framework facilitates the job of journal editors for conducting an efficient and effective scientifc review process by exploiting the valuable available information on the modern scholarly Websites (e.g., Google Scholar, ACM, DBLP, Publon) for identifying candidate reviewers who are relevant to the topic of the manuscript, flters them (e.g. excluding those with potential conflict of interest), and ranks them based on several metrics confgured by the editor (user). The framework extracts the required information of the recommendation process from the online resources on-the-fly which ensures the the output recommendations to be dynamic and based on up-to-date information.

[![Project Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/rNHTqdY6GuI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNHTqdY6GuI)

This Web application project is built on top of <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-view-template architectural pattern. All the implemented services can be found in ```forrmsApp/Functions``` while the main web pages work flow can be found in ```forrmsApp/views.py```, and ```forrmsApp/tasks.py```
